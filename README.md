Athena
======

Athena is a plugin for source mod which monitors the live gamestate of a counter-strike source server,
and updates an online scoreboard accordingly.  Scores are updated for both teams and players at the end of
every round.  You are going to need to modify the source file where commented to do so, your installation
directories will differ from ours, and the plugin needs to reflect that.  The php file will need to be
modified to reflect differences in directory structures.
